📌 Project Overview
The U.S. housing market follows a predictable seasonal cycle. Prices and turnover rates peak in spring and summer (April–September), then decline in autumn and winter (October–March). These cycles are persistent, visible across regions, and challenge traditional microeconomic theory.

This project aims to empirically measure this seasonality, identify its geographical variation, and investigate the economic, political, cultural, and behavioral forces that sustain it. Surprisingly, prices and sales volumes often rise and fall together, which goes against the expected price-demand relationship. This “in-phase” movement raises questions about search frictions, asymmetric information, and behavioral biases in the housing market.

By applying time-series econometric tools and exploring the broader theoretical literature, this study offers both academic insight and practical implications for buyers, sellers, and policymakers.

📊 Objectives
Establish seasonal trends in house prices and turnover across the U.S.

Compare how these trends differ by region and time

Explain the observed patterns using theoretical and empirical economic literature

🧠 Economic Rationale
“Prices rise when demand increases. But why do prices and sales rise together?”
— A paradox tackled in Hot and Cold Markets (Novy-Marx, 2009)

Supporting Theories
Search Frictions

Turnover accelerates in hot seasons due to greater market liquidity

Housing search models (Wheaton, 1990) explain timing dynamics

Information Asymmetry

Sellers strategically list homes to maximize returns during high-visibility periods

(Hendel & Nevo, 2013)

Behavioral Economics

Buyers anchor expectations on seasonal norms (Genesove & Mayer, 2001)
