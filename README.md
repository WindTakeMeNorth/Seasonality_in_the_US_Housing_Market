📌 Project Overview
The U.S. housing market exhibits strong seasonal cycles. Every year, prices and turnover rates peak between April and September and dip from October to March. This project analyzes those seasonal trends using formal econometric tools and explains the economic rationale behind them.

📊 Objectives
Empirically identify seasonality in U.S. housing prices and turnover rates.
Visualize and test seasonal components using time-series analysis.
Interpret patterns using literature in economic theory, behavioral finance, and regional policy.

📁 Data Sources
Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA): Monthly housing price indices
U.S. Census Bureau:
Number of houses sold per month
Inventory of houses for sale
Prices by construction stage and region
Type of financing used

🧪 Methodology
Seasonal Extraction:
X-12 / X-13 ARIMA-SEATS procedure
Formal Seasonality Testing:
Parametric F-Test
Kruskal–Wallis test
Two-way ANOVA (Moving Seasonality Test)

🧠 Key Insight
"Both prices and sales volumes go up together—challenging the classic demand curve. Why?"
— Inspired by Hot and Cold Markets (Novy-Marx, 2009)
This anomaly is explored through:
Supply-demand shock amplifications
Behavioral patterns (e.g., school calendar, election uncertainty)
Climate and cultural influences
